# What is docker?

- Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. 
- Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
- With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.
- Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production

## Why we should use docker instead of VMs
- Docker containers are much smaller and require far fewer resources than a VM.
- Docker is fast. While a VM can take an at least a few minutes to boot, it takes anywhere from a few milliseconds to (at most) a few seconds to start a Docker container from a container image.
- Containers can be shared across multiple team members, bringing much-needed portability across the development pipeline. This reduces ‘works on my machine’ errors that plague DevOps teams.
